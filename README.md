# Wireshark
I started by installing a Ubuntu VM on my Virtualbox
When Ubuntu was setup I ran the following commands: 
To upgrade my sytem: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
To install Wireshark: `sudo apt install wireshark -y`
I also selected yes for wireshark to allow non-superusers to be able to capture packets
After it was completed I ran the command `Wireshark` which opened wireshark
